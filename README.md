## Post Types
Outside the standard set of wordpress post types Schoocms has its own set of post types to allow modification.
### Call Outs
Call outs are a large wide single block of text with a link. They always take up a single row with either an image or plain background with a button link beneath text
### Points of Interest
Works similar to callouts but they work as single link block. They can be set to a row of 1 to 3. They will have significantly less text on them and will be more of a promt to directly go to said page rather than giving them more information.
### Quotes
Quotes are testimonials or quote that will be used across the site or within a quote slider.
### Staff
Staff of the school or people of interest.
### Documents
Downloads and policies that can be added across the site and updated directly through here rather than going page by page to update them.
